        <h2>Importance of dreaming</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">Dreaming is a power that drives human progress. It's through our dreams that we access our 
            deepest creativity and vision for the future. We're reclaiming the art of dreaming as a 
            vital tool for innovation and positive change. The dreams of yesterday are being reimagined 
            today - evolving into new, bold visions that inspire action and create real impact. This is the 
            nature of innovation: building the future through intentional thinking and collaborative progress. 
            Let's embrace dreaming now and transform our shared vision into tangible reality.</p>

        <h2>Future authoring Surrey</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">One of the powerful Design Thinking methods is future authoring. The concept of writing the future 
            which the designer envisons or dreams up, as though it is already happened. It's real. This article is a future authored 
            vision for Surrey in 2035, outlining all the aspects of life in Surrey that have been transformed through innovation,
            technology, and community collaboration. Read it as though it is already 2035.
