            <p class="flow-text">Jason went out networking in Central London today and met two Surrey based entrepreneurs who were very interested in Silicon Surrey.
                One is based in Guildford and predominantly an investor and the other in Croydon and a founder of an AI based shipping optimisation company. Connections 
                were made and follow ups will be happening soon. Jason also re-connected with his old colleague who is an HR specialist and whispered to her about Silicon Surrey.
                She immediately loved the idea, especially the tagline of 'Redesigning humanity from Surrey'.

            <p class="flow-text">We continue to build our web presence and work on formalising the Silicon Surrey presentation, to enable various people to easily 
                understand what we are working on and how they can get involved. Post New Year spirit is still on, so many are away from work. We are thinking that 
                next week will be a good time to start reaching out to potential allies and supporters to start building momentum for Silicon Surrey in 2026.

            <p class="flow-text">We start 2026 as a true New Year for Silicon Surrey. Website development is in full swing at the moment. Website is serving as 
                a guiding structure to set up the processes and workflows for onboarding various stakeholders into the project. We are slowly gearing up to 
                lift off into a more publicly facing promotional phase. Lots to do to start getting the cogs of the system moving forward. Exciting times ahead!
