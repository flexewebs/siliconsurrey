            <p class="flow-text">We start 2026 as a true New Year for Silicon Surrey. Website development is in full swing at the moment. Website is serving as 
                a guiding structure to set up the processes and workflows for onboarding various stakeholders into the project. We are slowly gearing up to 
                lift off into a more publicly facing promotional phase. Lots to do to start getting the cogs of the system moving forward. Exciting times ahead!
